# BlackJack

A small project that I created in my free time to start with the development of my first games and go escalating to more complex things. I wanted to start with a well known game and later I will try with popular games from Mexico.

You can enjoy it online for the moment at the link in the description or right here in the repo.

Soon I'll be developing a desktop version with ElectronJS, stay tuned... :wink: :metal:
